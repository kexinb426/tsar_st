It's a large plastic ring which children put around their middles. They then move their bodies to move the hula hoop and try to prevent it from falling down. Wasfia Nazreen first saw a hula hoop as a young girl, when she saw a foreign child playing with one in Bangladesh, her home country. Wasfia could only stand and watch, because in her country people believed that girls should not play with hula hoops or ride bikes. Now, Wasfia has climbed the highest mountain on every continent in the world - all seven, including Everest and Kilimanjaro - which only a few people in the world have done. She has also hula-hooped on each peak. Her reason for doing so: to make women and girls feel they can do a wider range of things in a country which does not encourage them to do sport.", "avoid_words": ["empower", "hoop", "hooped", "hoops", "hula", "peak", "reluctantly"], "named_entities": ["bangladesh", "everest", "kilimanjaro", "nazreen", "wasfia"]}

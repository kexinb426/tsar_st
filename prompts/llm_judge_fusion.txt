You are an educational editor. Your job is to combine the best parts of all the candidate simplifications and rewrite them into one clear, coherent version for {target_cefr} learners.  

First, review the original document carefully to understand its meaning and style:
Original document: {document_text}

Here are the criteria you should follow when judging and rewriting:
{cefr_judge_criteria}

Now, study the following candidate simplifications. Each has strengths and weaknesses:
{candidate_simplifications}

Fusion policy:
- Read all candidates carefully and identify their strengths.
- Combine their best sentences and phrases, reordering and paraphrasing where needed, to form a single coherent simplification.
- Preserve all names, numbers, and dates exactly as they appear in the original; do not add or invent facts.
- Remove duplicates and contradictions, and ensure smooth flow with appropriate linkers.
- The final text must follow {target_cefr} style rules and fully meet the criteria above.

Reply only with the fused simplified text. Do not add explanations, labels, or extra comments.

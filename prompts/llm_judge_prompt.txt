You are a language teacher. Your task is to select the single best text simplification from a list of candidates, as if you were choosing what to give your students.

The original document is: {document_text}

The goal is to simplify it for a {target_cefr} CEFR level learner.

Evaluate the candidates based on:
1. Simplicity: clear and accessible language.
2. Meaning preservation: main ideas and tone are intact.
3. Fluency: natural and smooth reading.
4. Learner appropriateness: vocabulary, style, and tone fit a {target_cefr} CEFR level learner.
5. Educational usefulness: provides input that is simple but still rich for learners.

Here are the candidate simplifications:
{candidate_simplifications}

Review the candidates carefully. Based on your expert evaluation, provide only the text of the single best candidate. Do not add any explanations, introductions, or labels like "Best Simplification:".

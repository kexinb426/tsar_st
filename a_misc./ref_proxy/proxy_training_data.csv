- Offer flexible working hours. For example, let people start earlier or later.
- Let employees choose where they work, for example at home or in the office.

- Give staff new and interesting tasks to help them grow.
- Praise good work and say thank you often.

We think the company should care more about its workers. Here are our ideas:

First, workers should have flexible working hours. This means they can choose when to start and finish work. Workers should also be able to work from home or other places they like.

Second, managers should give workers more interesting and difficult tasks. Managers should also say ""good job"" more often when workers do well.

Third, the company should spend more money on training. Workers need to learn how to talk to people better, especially people from different countries and cultures.

If Girox Foods does these things, workers will be happier and do better work.",0.7123,0.6238,1.0841121495327102,1.2636363636363637,139,72.75950000000003,1.2158273381294964,11

DNA is like a book inside our bodies that tells us about our genes.","Scientists want to know if our genes help us learn language. Genes are very small things inside our bodies. They decide many things about us, like the color of our eyes.

Scientists think that long ago, between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, something changed in our genes. This change helped humans learn to speak. It also helped our brains control our mouths and faces when we talk.

Monkeys have genes that are like human genes. But monkeys don't have this special change in their genes. That's why monkeys can't speak like humans.

Scientists don't know everything about genes and language yet. But maybe one day they will find more answers. They will look at our DNA to learn more. DNA is like a book inside our bodies that tells us about our genes.",A2,A2,0.998,1,0.6227,0.8924,0.5853,0.8889,"['14-a2', '18-b1']"

Identify Barriers:
- ""Dreams of a phone call from an old friend"" might be complex. Simplify to ""dreaming about a call from an old friend.""
- ""Death of someone close"" can be emotional and complex. Simplify to ""dreaming about someone close dying.""

Based on the simplified words and explanations, rewrite the sentence retaining its core message. Use simpler structure and high-frequency vocabulary.

1. Pay attention to how people from other cultures speak and behave.

Our study shows that Girox Foods should care more about its people.  
First, give workers flexible hours.  
Second, let them choose where to work, for example at home or in the office.  

Managers should:  
• give workers new and interesting tasks, and  
• say “well done” when workers do good work.  

The company should also spend more money on training, especially training in how to talk with people from different cultures.

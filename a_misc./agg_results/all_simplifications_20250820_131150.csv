Identify Barriers:
1. ""leading researcher"" - The term might be difficult as it combines two less common words.
2. ""Robotics and AI"" - These are specialized fields; ""AI"" might require definition.
3. ""extensively"", ""published"", ""peer-reviewed journals"" - These terms can be simplified.
4. ""speaks at international conferences"" - A simpler expression can be used.
5. ""prestigious Royal Academy Simone Fielding fellowship"" - This is a specific award and might need simplification or a brief explanation.
6. ""smart home"", ""designed herself"" - ""Smart home"" might need a simple definition or context.

Plan Simplifications:
1. ""leading researcher"" - Simplify to ""important scientist.""
2. ""Robotics and AI"" - Explain ""AI"" as ""robots and artificial intelligence (AI).""
3. ""extensively"", ""published"", ""peer-reviewed journals"" - Simplify to ""written many articles in important science magazines.""
4. ""speaks at international conferences"" - Simplify to ""talks at big meetings around the world.""
5. ""prestigious Royal Academy Simone Fielding fellowship"" - Simplify to ""a special award in 2012.""

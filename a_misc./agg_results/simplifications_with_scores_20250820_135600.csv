Managers should give workers new tasks that let them learn and grow.

They ask: Did some genes change and give people the power to speak?  

They found one gene that changed a very long time ago, between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago.  
This change seems to help us move our mouth and face when we speak.  

Monkeys have almost the same gene, but it did not change in them.  

We still do not know how much genes help language, but maybe we will find the answer in our DNA one day.","Scientists want to know how our genes help our brain and language.

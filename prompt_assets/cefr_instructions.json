  "A2": "Pretend that you are explaining this to an beginner English learner who needs short and simple sentences. Replace words with a simple synonym whenever possible, and only explain key jargons with a brief explanation. Use simple subject-verb-object (SVO) order with no subordinate or nested clauses. Avoid using present perfect tense, conditionals, passive voice, and relative clauses. Connect sentences with linkers such as 'and', 'but', 'so', 'because', 'then', 'first', 'next', 'finally' to make the text flow logically. Keep all names, numbers, and dates exactly as they are; do not add or remove facts. If a pronoun is unclear, repeat the noun instead.",
  "B1": "Replace low-frequency words with more common words, but keep important topic terms as-is, and add a short explanation if they may be difficult. Simplify within sentences when possible, but split a sentence if it contains a long or interrupting relative clause, more than two connected clauses, heavy parenthetical information, or a long list. Preserve all names, numbers, and dates exactly as they are; do not add or remove facts."

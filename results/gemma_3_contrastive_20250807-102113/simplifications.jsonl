The company should change. The managers should see the workers as more important. For example, if the workers want to change when and where they work, it should be possible. We should give workers different jobs sometimes so they will be more interested. We should also show them more often that we like their work.

It's too early to say how much influence genes have on language, but one day the answers might be found in our DNA.\nSimplified Document: There are other questions. For example, what does our biology do to our brains and our language? In the past, did something change in our biology and then we could make language? Science has found that there was a change in our biology between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. Maybe the change affected speaking, because it was about how our brains move our mouths and faces. Monkeys, for example, did not change in the same way. We don't know the answers to these questions yet, but in the future, if we study our biology and history enough, we may find the answers.\n---\nB1 Level Examples:\nComplex Document: I used to do a typical five-day week, but after I came out of my parental leave, I decided that I wanted to spend more time with my children before they start school.

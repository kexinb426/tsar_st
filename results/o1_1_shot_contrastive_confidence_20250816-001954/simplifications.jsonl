Are there genes that mutated and gave us language ability? Researchers have found a gene mutation that occurred between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, which seems to have a connection with speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face. Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not undergo this mutation. It's too early to say how much influence genes have on language, but one day the answers might be found in our DNA.\nSimplified Document:", "raw_model_output": "Scientists are studying how our genes affect the way our brain and language skills develop. Some wonder if certain genes changed in humans and allowed us to speak.

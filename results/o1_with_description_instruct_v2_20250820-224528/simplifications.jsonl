Of the 25,000 estimated asteroids of this size, so far about 8,000 have been logged, leaving 17,000 unaccounted for. Considering that a 19-metre asteroid that exploded above the city of Chelyabinsk in Russia in 2013 injured 1,200 people, these middle-sized asteroids would be a serious danger if they enter Earth's orbit.\nSimplified Document:\n", "raw_model_output": "NASA and experts watch asteroids to protect Earth.  \nNASA logs many smaller asteroids in space today.  \nThese asteroids often measure 140 meters wide or more.  \nScientists estimate there are 25,000 such asteroids in total.  \nNASA tracks 8,000 asteroids in space at this time.  \n17,000 other asteroids are not on NASA's list.  \nIn 2013, a 19-meter asteroid exploded over Chelyabinsk in Russia.  \nThat explosion injured 1,200 people in that city.  \nThese middle-sized asteroids are a serious danger for our planet.  \nThey can enter Earth's orbit and cause great harm.", "few_shot_example_ids": []}

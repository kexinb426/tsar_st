For example, what does our biology do to our brains and our language? In the past, did something change in our biology and then we could make language? Science has found that there was a change in our biology between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. Maybe the change affected speaking, because it was about how our brains move our mouths and faces. Monkeys, for example, did not change in the same way. We don't know the answers to these questions yet, but in the future, if we study our biology and history enough, we may find the answers.\n---\nB1 Level Examples:\nComplex Document: The Life of Pi tells the extraordinary story of Pi, a teenage boy from India, who is shipwrecked and finds himself trapped in a lifeboat in the Pacific Ocean with a ferocious tiger.

Are there genes that mutated and gave us language ability? Researchers have found a gene mutation that occurred between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, which seems to have a connection with speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face. Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not undergo this mutation. It's too early to say how much influence genes have on language, but one day the answers might be found in our DNA.\nSimplified Document: More questions appear if we look at the historical effects of our biology on our brains and language development. In the past, did changes in our biology give us language ability? Research has found a change that took place between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, and it seems this change is connected with speaking and how our brains control our mouths and faces. Monkeys have a similar biology to us, but they did not experience this change. Have changes like this affected our language development, and if so, how much? It's too early for us to know yet, but one day, after more research, we might find the answers.\n---\n\nNow, use what you have learned about the differences between the levels.

Are there genes that mutated and gave us language ability? Researchers have found a gene mutation that occurred between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, which seems to have a connection with speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face. Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not undergo this mutation. It's too early to say how much influence genes have on language, but one day the answers might be found in our DNA.\nSimplified Document: There are other questions. For example, what does our biology do to our brains and our language? In the past, did something change in our biology and then we could make language? Science has found that there was a change in our biology between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. Maybe the change affected speaking, because it was about how our brains move our mouths and faces.

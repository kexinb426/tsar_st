Increased investment in professional development, especially in the area of social and intercultural communication, could also contribute to creating a positive environment for employees to produce their best work.\nSimplified Document: We've looked carefully at Girox Foods, and we have some advice. The company should change. The managers should see the workers as more important. For example, if the workers want to change when and where they work, it should be possible. We should give workers different jobs sometimes so they will be more interested. We should also show them more often that we like their work. We should spend more money on teaching them, for example about how to talk to people, especially people from other countries. If we do all these things, this will be a better place to work, and then people can do their best work here.\n---\n\nNow, following the same pattern, simplify the following text.

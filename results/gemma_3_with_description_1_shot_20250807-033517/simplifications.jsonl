A lack of understanding of the cultural norms and practices of our business acquaintances can result in unfair judgements, misunderstandings and breakdowns in communication.

However, what businesses expect from their communications might be very different from culture to culture. If we do not have enough knowledge of the normal ways of doing things in our business partners' and customers' cultures, we may misunderstand them and judge them unfairly as a result, and our relationships may get worse.

Although national cultures could play a part in shaping the way we behave and think, we are also largely influenced by the region we come from, the communities we associate with, our age and gender, our corporate culture and our individual experiences of the world. The knowledge of the potential differences should therefore be something we keep at the back of our minds, rather than something that we use to pigeonhole the individuals of an entire nation.\nSimplified Document: \n", "raw_model_output": "Knowing that people might have different ideas and ways of behaving can help us avoid misunderstandings. However, it\u2019s important to remember that making assumptions about people based on their nationality can be bad for building good relationships.

So, it\u2019s good to be aware of these differences, but we shouldn\u2019t use them to judge individuals based on their country of origin.", "few_shot_example_ids": ["11-b1"]}

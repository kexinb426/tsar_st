However, we must also remember that using cultural stereotypes can harm our business relationships. While a country\u2019s culture can shape how we behave and think, many other factors also matter. For example, we are influenced by where we come from, the groups we belong to, our age, our gender, our company\u2019s culture, and our personal life experiences.

Her reason for doing so: to empower women and girls in a country which discourages them from doing sport. \nSimplified Document: A 'hula hoop' is a kind of toy. It's a large circle of plastic. Children stand inside it, pick it up, put it around their middles, then move their bodies: they are trying to stop the hula hoop from falling down. The first time Wasfia Nazreen saw a hula hoop, she was a young girl living in Bangladesh. A foreign girl was playing with it. Wasfia wanted to try it, but she didn't, because people in Bangladesh didn't think girls should play with hula hoops or ride bikes. Now, Wasfia has climbed seven of the highest mountains in the world and, at the top of every mountain, she uses her hula hoop. Nobody else has ever done that! She does it because she wants to show other women and girls in her country that they can do different things. Her country doesn't like women who do sport.\n---\nB1 Level Examples:\nComplex Document: Unlike many other best-selling album artists, Springsteen is still releasing chart-topping, stadium-filling new music and remains at the top of his game in his late 60s.

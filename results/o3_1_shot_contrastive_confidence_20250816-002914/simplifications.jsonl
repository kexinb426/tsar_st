Genes are tiny parts inside our bodies that we get from our parents. Sometimes a gene can change. Scientists ask: did a special change in a gene give people the power to use language? They found one gene that changed a very long time ago, about 200,000 to 100,000 years ago. This change seems to help humans move the mouth and face to make words. Monkeys have almost the same gene, but their gene did not change. We still do not know exactly how much genes affect language.

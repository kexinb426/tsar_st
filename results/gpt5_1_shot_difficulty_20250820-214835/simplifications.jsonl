A lack of understanding of the cultural norms and practices of our business acquaintances can result in unfair judgements, misunderstandings and breakdowns in communication. Here are three basic areas of differences in the business etiquette around the world that could help stand you in good stead when you next find yourself working with someone from a different culture.\nSimplified Document: Much of today's business is carried out across international borders, and most businesses across the world use English as a common language. However, what businesses expect from their communications might be very different from culture to culture. If we do not have enough knowledge of the normal ways of doing things in our business partners' and customers' cultures, we may misunderstand them and judge them unfairly as a result, and our relationships may get worse. Here are three basic areas of differences in business culture around the world that could help you when you next work with someone from a different culture.\n---\n\nNow, following the same pattern, simplify the following text. Reply only with the simplified text, and nothing else.\n\nComplex Document: Having an increased awareness of the possible differences in expectations and behaviour can help us avoid cases of miscommunication, but it is vital that we also remember that cultural stereotypes can be detrimental to building good business relationships. Although national cultures could play a part in shaping the way we behave and think, we are also largely influenced by the region we come from, the communities we associate with, our age and gender, our corporate culture and our individual experiences of the world. The knowledge of the potential differences should therefore be something we keep at the back of our minds, rather than something that we use to pigeonhole the individuals of an entire nation.\nSimplified Document: \n", "raw_model_output": "Understanding that people may have different expectations and behave differently can help us avoid communication problems. But it is very important to remember that cultural stereotypes can harm good business relationships. National culture can affect how we think and act, but many other things also influence us: our region, the groups we belong to, our age and gender, our company culture, and our own life experiences. So we should keep these possible differences in mind, but we should not use them to label people or judge everyone in a nation in the same way.", "few_shot_example_ids": ["11-b1"]}

Engineers study the problem to find out the real cause. Sometimes, builders used poor materials, or important parts were flawed. Other times, the bridge can only hold a certain weight, and if it is too heavy, the bridge will fail.\n\nCandidate 5:\nSome bridges collapse suddenly. At first, engineers do not know why. After they study the bridge, they find the reason. Sometimes the materials are poor, or an important part is broken. Other times, a bridge can only carry a certain weight.

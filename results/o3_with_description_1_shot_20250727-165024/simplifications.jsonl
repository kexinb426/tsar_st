As part of this, we should explore ways of offering more flexible working hours to our employees and consider how we can enable employees to work from their chosen locations. Managers need to consider a variety of ways to challenge our staff and provide more positive reinforcement and recognition of the work they do. Increased investment in professional development, especially in the area of social and intercultural communication, could also contribute to creating a positive environment for employees to produce their best work.\nSimplified Document: We've looked carefully at Girox Foods, and we have some advice. The company should change. The managers should see the workers as more important. For example, if the workers want to change when and where they work, it should be possible. We should give workers different jobs sometimes so they will be more interested. We should also show them more often that we like their work. We should spend more money on teaching them, for example about how to talk to people, especially people from other countries. If we do all these things, this will be a better place to work, and then people can do their best work here.\n---\n\nNow, following the same pattern, simplify the following text.

Although national cultures could play a part in shaping the way we behave and think, we are also largely influenced by the region we come from, the communities we associate with, our age and gender, our corporate culture and our individual experiences of the world. The knowledge of the potential differences should therefore be something we keep at the back of our minds, rather than something that we use to pigeonhole the individuals of an entire nation.\nSimplified Document: An increased knowledge of the possible differences in expectations and behaviour can help us avoid cases of miscommunication. However, it is essential that we also remember that what we believe about other cultures can negatively affect our business relationships. Although national cultures can affect the way we behave and think, in general, other factors also affect us, for example: the region we come from, the social groups we belong to, our age, being male or female, our company's culture, and our individual experiences of the world. Therefore, we should keep our knowledge of the possible differences at the back of our minds, rather than using it to make predictions about all the people in a country.\n---\n\nNow, following the same pattern, simplify the following text.

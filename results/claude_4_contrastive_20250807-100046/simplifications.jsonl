Are there genes that mutated and gave us language ability? Researchers have found a gene mutation that occurred between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, which seems to have a connection with speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face. Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not undergo this mutation.

For example, what does our biology do to our brains and our language? In the past, did something change in our biology and then we could make language? Science has found that there was a change in our biology between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. Maybe the change affected speaking, because it was about how our brains move our mouths and faces.

In some cases, this could happen because inferior-quality material was used in the construction, or because of a defect in a key piece of the bridge. In other cases, the bridge was designed only to support a certain amount of weight and no more.\nSimplified Document: Sometimes, when a bridge falls down, nobody knows why. To understand what happened, engineers have to study it a lot. Sometimes, a bridge falls down because its materials (such as stone or metal) are not strong enough, or because there is a problem with an important part of the bridge. Or sometimes, the traffic on the bridge just becomes too heavy for it.\n---\nB1 Level Examples:\nComplex Document: On the basis of these findings, we recommend that Girox Foods adopt a more people-oriented management style. As part of this, we should explore ways of offering more flexible working hours to our employees and consider how we can enable employees to work from their chosen locations.

Increased investment in professional development, especially in the area of social and intercultural communication, could also contribute to creating a positive environment for employees to produce their best work.\nSimplified Document: Looking at these research results, we recommend that Girox Foods changes its management style so that it begins to attach more importance to its employees.

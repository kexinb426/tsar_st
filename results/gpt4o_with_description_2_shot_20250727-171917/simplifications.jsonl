It was at the time of the US invasion of Iraq. The only programmes she could find on TV were 'reality' programmes of young people competing to win a million dollars and news programmes about the war. Suzanne says that the two things start to merge together in a disturbing way and the idea for The Hunger Games came to her.\nSimplified Document: One night in 2003, Suzanne Collins was watching TV, changing from one channel to another every few minutes. It was at the time of the U.S.-Iraq war. The news programmes were about the war, and the only other programmes were shows about young people competing to win a million dollars. Suzanne says that the two types of programmes started to come together in her mind in an unpleasant way and the idea for The Hunger Games came to her.\n---\nComplex Document: On the basis of these findings, we recommend that Girox Foods adopt a more people-oriented management style. As part of this, we should explore ways of offering more flexible working hours to our employees and consider how we can enable employees to work from their chosen locations. Managers need to consider a variety of ways to challenge our staff and provide more positive reinforcement and recognition of the work they do. Increased investment in professional development, especially in the area of social and intercultural communication, could also contribute to creating a positive environment for employees to produce their best work.\nSimplified Document: Looking at these research results, we recommend that Girox Foods changes its management style so that it begins to attach more importance to its employees. As part of this, we should consider ways of offering our employees opportunities to change their working hours and also locations. Managers need to consider a variety of ways to give our staff a challenge and to show they notice and support the work they do.

They've wasted tonnes of food, they've underpaid their suppliers and they've contributed to excessive plastic waste in their packaging, which has had its impact on our environment. But supermarkets and grocers are starting to sit up and take notice. In response to growing consumer backlash against the huge amounts of plastic waste generated by plastic packaging, some of the largest UK supermarkets have signed up to a pact promising to transform packaging and cut plastic wastage.\nSimplified Document: Some people are angry at the big supermarkets. They say they do many bad or wrong things. For example, they throw away a lot of food, they buy things cheaply and sell them expensively, and the things they sell include too much plastic, which is bad for our world. But big and small shops are starting to do something, because their customers are getting more unhappy about the problem of too much plastic. Some of the largest supermarkets in the UK now say they are going to change the things they sell to use less plastic.\n---\nComplex Document: Some bridge collapses are mysteries, and engineers only realise why after they conduct a complete investigation. In some cases, this could happen because inferior-quality material was used in the construction, or because of a defect in a key piece of the bridge. In other cases, the bridge was designed only to support a certain amount of weight and no more.\nSimplified Document: Sometimes, when a bridge falls down, nobody knows why. To understand what happened, engineers have to study it a lot. Sometimes, a bridge falls down because its materials (such as stone or metal) are not strong enough, or because there is a problem with an important part of the bridge. Or sometimes, the traffic on the bridge just becomes too heavy for it.\n---\n\nNow, following the same pattern, simplify the following text.

A lack of understanding of the cultural norms and practices of our business acquaintances can result in unfair judgements, misunderstandings and breakdowns in communication. Here are three basic areas of differences in the business etiquette around the world that could help stand you in good stead when you next find yourself working with someone from a different culture.\nSimplified Document: Often, business today is international, and most international businesses use English as a shared language. However, businesses in different countries might expect very different things when they talk to each other. If we do not know what is normal for businesses in other cultures, we may not understand them, we might think wrong things about them, and our relationships with them may get worse. Here are three types of differences in business cultures around the world.

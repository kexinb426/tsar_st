Are there genes that mutated and gave us language ability? Researchers have found a gene mutation that occurred between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, which seems to have a connection with speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face. Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not undergo this mutation. It's too early to say how much influence genes have on language, but one day the answers might be found in our DNA.\nSimplified Document:", "raw_model_output": "Scientists want to know how genes affect our brain and language. A gene is a small piece of information in our body. We get genes from our parents. Sometimes a gene changes. This change is called a mutation.\n\nScientists ask: Did a gene change help humans use language?\n\nThey found one gene that changed about 200,000 to 100,000 years ago. This change seems to be connected to speaking and to how our brain moves our mouth and face. Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not change like this.\n\nWe still do not know how much genes help with language. Maybe, in the future, we will find the answers in our DNA. DNA is the long code inside our body.", "few_shot_example_ids": ["14-a2", "18-b1"]}

Wasfia reluctantly stood by and watched, as in her country it was believed that girls should not play with hula hoops or ride bikes. Now Wasfia is one of the few people in the world to have climbed the Seven Summits, including Everest and Kilimanjaro, and the first to have hula-hooped on each peak.

Children stand inside it, pick it up, put it around their middles, then move their bodies: they are trying to stop the hula hoop from falling down. The first time Wasfia Nazreen saw a hula hoop, she was a young girl living in Bangladesh. A foreign girl was playing with it. Wasfia wanted to try it, but she didn't, because people in Bangladesh didn't think girls should play with hula hoops or ride bikes. Now, Wasfia has climbed seven of the highest mountains in the world and, at the top of every mountain, she uses her hula hoop. Nobody else has ever done that! She does it because she wants to show other women and girls in her country that they can do different things. Her country doesn't like women who do sport.\n---\nB1 Level Examples:\nComplex Document: Unlike many other best-selling album artists, Springsteen is still releasing chart-topping, stadium-filling new music and remains at the top of his game in his late 60s.

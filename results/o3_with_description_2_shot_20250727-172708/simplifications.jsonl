Although national cultures could play a part in shaping the way we behave and think, we are also largely influenced by the region we come from, the communities we associate with, our age and gender, our corporate culture and our individual experiences of the world. The knowledge of the potential differences should therefore be something we keep at the back of our minds, rather than something that we use to pigeonhole the individuals of an entire nation.\nSimplified Document: If we know more about other cultures, that can help people from different countries to understand each other better. However, we must also be careful that what we know does not affect our business relationships badly. It's true that the things we do and think come from our country's culture. But they also come from other things too, for example: the area we live in, the company we work at, being a man or a woman, our family and friends, our age, and our past.

Are there genes that mutated and gave us language ability? Researchers have found a gene mutation that occurred between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, which seems to have a connection with speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face. Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not undergo this mutation. It's too early to say how much influence genes have on language, but one day the answers might be found in our DNA.\nSimplified Document: There are other questions. For example, what does our biology do to our brains and our language? In the past, did something change in our biology and then we could make language? Science has found that there was a change in our biology between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. Maybe the change affected speaking, because it was about how our brains move our mouths and faces.

As part of this, we should explore ways of offering more flexible working hours to our employees and consider how we can enable employees to work from their chosen locations.

Increased investment in professional development, especially in the area of social and intercultural communication, could also contribute to creating a positive environment for employees to produce their best work.\nSimplified Document: We've looked carefully at Girox Foods, and we have some advice. The company should change. The managers should see the workers as more important. For example, if the workers want to change when and where they work, it should be possible. We should give workers different jobs sometimes so they will be more interested. We should also show them more often that we like their work.

Are there genes that mutated and gave us language ability? Researchers have found a gene mutation that occurred between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, which seems to have a connection with speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face. Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not undergo this mutation. It's too early to say how much influence genes have on language, but one day the answers might be found in our DNA.\nSimplified Document: There are other questions. For example, what does our biology do to our brains and our language? In the past, did something change in our biology and then we could make language? Science has found that there was a change in our biology between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago. Maybe the change affected speaking, because it was about how our brains move our mouths and faces. Monkeys, for example, did not change in the same way.

As part of this, we should explore ways of offering more flexible working hours to our employees and consider how we can enable employees to work from their chosen locations.

Increased investment in professional development, especially in the area of social and intercultural communication, could also contribute to creating a positive environment for employees to produce their best work.\nSimplified Document: We've looked carefully at Girox Foods, and we have some advice. The company should change. The managers should see the workers as more important. For example, if the workers want to change when and where they work, it should be possible. We should give workers different jobs sometimes so they will be more interested. We should also show them more often that we like their work. We should spend more money on teaching them, for example about how to talk to people, especially people from other countries.

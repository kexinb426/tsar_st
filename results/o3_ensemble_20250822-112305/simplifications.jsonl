Nobody knows how this connects to language. Human brains did not suddenly get bigger, but humans became more complex and smarter. Did using language help their brains grow? Or did more complex brains start to create language?\n\nCandidate 2:\nBetween about 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, humans began to do new things, such as making cave paintings. We do not know if these paintings were connected to language. At that time, our brains did not suddenly become bigger, but people became more complex and smarter. Did language make our brains grow, or did a more complex brain lead to language?\n\nCandidate 3:\nAbout 100,000 to 50,000 years ago, we began to see early humans. They painted pictures in caves. No one knows how this connects to language. Human brains did not get bigger all at once, but people became smarter and could do more. Did language help the brain grow? Or did language come because the brain grew first?\n\nCandidate 4:\nAbout 100,000 to 50,000 years ago, people made paintings on cave walls. We do not know if these paintings are related to language. The human brain did not grow much bigger, but people became smarter. Did language make their brains grow, or did their smarter brains create language?\n\nCandidate 5:\nAround 100,000 to 50,000 years ago, people made cave paintings. These were early signs of human civilization. Nobody knows how they are related to language. At that time, the human brain did not suddenly grow bigger, but people became more complex and smarter. Did language help the brain grow, or did humans become more complex first and then develop language?\n\nCandidate 6:\nA long time ago, between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, people started to make pictures on the walls of caves. This shows us that people were becoming smarter. But we don't know if this is connected to language. Language is how people talk to each other with words. People's brains didn't get bigger, but people became more intelligent. We don't know why this happened. Did people become smarter because they started using language? Or did people start using language because their brains became smarter? Nobody knows the answer.\n\nCandidate 7:\nLong, long ago, about 100,000 to 50,000 years ago, we see the first signs of people living together. For example, people made pictures on cave walls. We don\u2019t know if these pictures are connected to talking. People\u2019s brains didn\u2019t become bigger, but people became more clever and more complicated. Did talking help their brains to grow? Or did their clever brains help them to start talking?\n\nCandidate 8:\nBetween 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, we can see early signs of how humans lived. For example, people made pictures on cave walls. We do not know how this is linked to language. Brains did not suddenly get bigger, but life became more complicated, and people became more clever. Did using language make their brains grow? Or did more complicated brains make language?\n\nCandidate 9:\nBetween 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, people began to show signs of early civilisation. For example, they painted pictures in caves. Nobody knows if this is linked to language. Their brains did not suddenly grow bigger, but people became smarter. Did speaking make their brains grow?

So, remember that people can be different, but do not think that everyone from one country is the same.\n\nCandidate 4:\nIf we understand that people think and act differently, we can avoid many problems. But we must remember that strong ideas about culture can hurt our business relationships. People from different countries have different cultures, but our hometown, community, age, gender, company culture, and personal experiences also affect us. We should keep these differences in mind, but not use them to label everyone.\n\nCandidate 5:\nPeople can have different expectations and ways of acting. Knowing this can help us avoid misunderstandings. But we should remember that stereotypes can harm good teamwork. Our thoughts and actions come from our country's culture, but we also learn from our region, group, age, gender, company, and personal experiences. We should keep these differences in mind, yet not use them to label everyone.\n\nCandidate 6:\nIt is good to know that people from different countries may think and act differently. This can help us talk to them better and avoid problems. But we must be careful. We should not think that all people from one country are the same. This is wrong and can make business relationships bad.\n\nPeople are different for many reasons. Yes, their country can change how they think and act. But there are other things too. Where they live in their country is important. The people they spend time with are important. Their age matters. If they are a man or woman matters. The company they work for can change them. All the things that happen in their life make them different.\n\nSo we should remember that people from different countries may be different. But we should not put all people from one country in the same group. Every person is different.\n\nCandidate 7:\nSometimes, we need to think about how people might do things differently. This can help us avoid mistakes when we talk. But it's also important to remember that ideas about different countries can be bad. Countries are different, and people are different too. We are also affected by where we live, our friends, how old we are, if we are a man or a woman, our work place, and our own experiences. So, we should remember these things, but not to think that everyone from a country is the same.\n\nCandidate 8:\nPeople from different places can expect different things and act in different ways. If we know this, we can avoid miscommunication (not understanding each other). But we must also remember: cultural stereotypes are bad. A stereotype is a simple idea about a whole group. It can hurt good business relationships.\n\nHow we think and act is not only from our country. It also comes from the part of the country we come from, the groups we are in, our age and gender, the way our company works, and our own life experiences.\n\nSo, it is good to know about possible differences. Keep this in mind, but do not judge people or put them in a box because of their country.\n\nCandidate 9:\nPeople from different places sometimes think and act in different ways. If we understand this, we can avoid problems when we talk to each other. But it is also very important to remember that judging people by their culture can hurt our work together. Our country can shape us, but so can the area we live in, our friends, our age, our gender, our workplace, and our own experiences. We should keep these differences in mind, but we should not say everyone from one country is the same.\n\nReview the candidates carefully.

It is too early to know how much genes influence language, but one day we might find the answers in our DNA.\n\nCandidate 7:\nThere\u2019s also a lot to learn about how genes affect the way our brains and language develop. Scientists are looking at whether there are specific genes that changed and helped us develop the ability to speak. They have found a gene change that happened about 200,000 to 100,000 years ago. This change seems to be connected to how we speak and how our brains control our mouths and faces. Monkeys have a similar gene, but it didn\u2019t change in the same way. It\u2019s still too early to know exactly how much genes affect language, but maybe we will find the answers in our DNA one day.\n\nCandidate 8:\nThere are still many questions about how our genes affect the development of the brain and language. Did some genes change in a way that gave humans the ability to use language? Researchers have found a gene mutation from 200,000 to 100,000 years ago that seems linked to speaking and to how our brains control the mouth and face. Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not change in this way. It is still too early to know how much genes influence language, but one day we may find the answers in our DNA.\n\nCandidate 9:\nScientists are studying how our genes affect the way our brain and language skills develop. Some wonder if certain genes changed in humans and allowed us to speak. Researchers have found a gene mutation that happened between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago, which seems linked to speech and the way our brain controls mouth and face movements. Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not change in the same way. It is still too early to know exactly how much genes affect language, but someday we might learn the truth by studying our DNA.\n\nReview the candidates carefully.

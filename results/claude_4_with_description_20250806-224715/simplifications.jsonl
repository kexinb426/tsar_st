Although national cultures could play a part in shaping the way we behave and think, we are also largely influenced by the region we come from, the communities we associate with, our age and gender, our corporate culture and our individual experiences of the world. The knowledge of the potential differences should therefore be something we keep at the back of our minds, rather than something that we use to pigeonhole the individuals of an entire nation.\nSimplified Document:", "raw_model_output": "Knowing about possible differences in what people expect and how they act can help us avoid misunderstandings. But we must also remember that cultural stereotypes can hurt business relationships. Our national culture may affect how we behave and think. However, other things also influence us. These include where we live, the groups we spend time with, our age and gender, our company culture, and our personal experiences. So we should keep knowledge about differences in mind, but we should not use it to put all people from one country into the same group.", "few_shot_example_ids": []}

A B1 level learner can read straightforward factual texts on subjects related to their field of interest with a satisfactory level of comprehension. To simplify, you may replace difficult words with simpler ones, elaborate, or remove them when possible. You may also break down a lengthy sentence into shorter, clear sentences. Ensure the revised sentence is grammatically correct, fluent, and maintains the core message of the original without changing its meaning. \n\nHere are some examples of how to simplify text for this level:\nComplex Document: Between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, though, we start to see the evidence of early human civilisation, through cave paintings for example; no one knows the connection between this and language. Brains didn't suddenly get bigger, yet humans did become more complex and more intelligent. Was it using language that caused their brains to develop? Or did their more complex brains start producing language?\nSimplified Document: Between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, however, we start to see signs of early human societies, through cave paintings for example; no one knows the connection between this and language. Brains didn't suddenly get bigger, yet humans became more complicated and more intelligent. Did the use of language make their brains develop? Or did their more developed brains start producing language?\n---\n\nNow, following the same pattern, simplify the following text. Do not add any extra explanations or introductions, just provide the simplified text.\n\nComplex Document: \nJulie Wong is a leading researcher in the field of Robotics and AI. She has been published extensively as author and co-author of over 50 papers in highly regarded, peer-reviewed journals. She frequently speaks at international conferences and was awarded the prestigious Royal Academy Simone Fielding fellowship in 2012.

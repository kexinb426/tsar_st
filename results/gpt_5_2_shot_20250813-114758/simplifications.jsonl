Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not undergo this mutation.

Children stand inside it, pick it up, put it around their middles, then move their bodies: they are trying to stop the hula hoop from falling down. The first time Wasfia Nazreen saw a hula hoop, she was a young girl living in Bangladesh. A foreign girl was playing with it. Wasfia wanted to try it, but she didn't, because people in Bangladesh didn't think girls should play with hula hoops or ride bikes. Now, Wasfia has climbed seven of the highest mountains in the world and, at the top of every mountain, she uses her hula hoop. Nobody else has ever done that! She does it because she wants to show other women and girls in her country that they can do different things. Her country doesn't like women who do sport.\n---\nComplex Document: The Hunger Games are an annual event, which the Capitol uses to remind the districts that they are being punished for rebelling.

As part of this, we should explore ways of offering more flexible working hours to our employees and consider how we can enable employees to work from their chosen locations. Managers need to consider a variety of ways to challenge our staff and provide more positive reinforcement and recognition of the work they do. Increased investment in professional development, especially in the area of social and intercultural communication, could also contribute to creating a positive environment for employees to produce their best work.\nSimplified Document: We've looked carefully at Girox Foods, and we have some advice. The company should change. The managers should see the workers as more important. For example, if the workers want to change when and where they work, it should be possible. We should give workers different jobs sometimes so they will be more interested. We should also show them more often that we like their work. We should spend more money on teaching them, for example about how to talk to people, especially people from other countries. If we do all these things, this will be a better place to work, and then people can do their best work here.\n---\nComplex Document: Having an increased awareness of the possible differences in expectations and behaviour can help us avoid cases of miscommunication, but it is vital that we also remember that cultural stereotypes can be detrimental to building good business relationships. Although national cultures could play a part in shaping the way we behave and think, we are also largely influenced by the region we come from, the communities we associate with, our age and gender, our corporate culture and our individual experiences of the world. The knowledge of the potential differences should therefore be something we keep at the back of our minds, rather than something that we use to pigeonhole the individuals of an entire nation.\nSimplified Document: If we know more about other cultures, that can help people from different countries to understand each other better. However, we must also be careful that what we know does not affect our business relationships badly. It's true that the things we do and think come from our country's culture. But they also come from other things too, for example: the area we live in, the company we work at, being a man or a woman, our family and friends, our age, and our past.
